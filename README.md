Before implementing our code, you need to download 3 files and save them in a folder name “model”.

Link download:

.prototxt file: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/caffe/models/colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt
.caffemodel file: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dx0qvhhp5hbcx7z/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel?dl=1
.npy file: https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/caffe/resources/pts_in_hull.npy

Then save folder "model" and file "main.py" in another folder.
